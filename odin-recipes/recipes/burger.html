Simple smoke-flavored burgers that will melt in your mouth. You'd swear they were expensive gourmet. Garnish with your favorite burger toppings. 

1 pound ground beef
¼ cup Worcestershire sauce
¼ cup Italian bread crumbs
½ tablespoon steak sauce (such as A.1.®)
½ tablespoon liquid smoke flavoring
4 slices sharp Cheddar cheese
4 hamburger buns, split 


Step 1

Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Step 2

Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, bread crumbs, steak sauce, and liquid smoke together in a bowl using your hands. Form mixture into 4 hamburger patties.
Step 3

Grill burgers for 5 minutes on the preheated grill. Flip and grill to your desired degree of doneness, about 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
Step 4

Remove burgers from grill and cover each with a slice of Cheddar cheese. Allow to rest and serve on hamburger buns.
